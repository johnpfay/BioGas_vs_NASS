The attached list is probably the same list ECU shared, which is to say, operations large enough to qualify as CAFO’s.  I thought *just maybe* Don would have a full list of poultry operations, but alas, this can’t be it.  

Don, by the way, has worked with treatment and A/D of poultry litter for some time so could be a good resource in terms of identifying the parameters for biogas production from poultry litter.

Copying everyone as Don could be a good resource in terms of figuring out energy potential by litter and bird type.

Tanja- It was good seeing you and hearing more about your background and dealings with Optima. 
You are right on the database. This is the CAFO list for this year. It only covers layers. The reason why it resonated with me on birds was layer operations are good candidates due to the sheer number of bird count. The country's largest, Rose Acre, operate 2 in the state. 
What was the reason why they don't list the  growers as CAFOs?

Hi Don -

It was nice seeing you today at the farm in Chatham.  I know the farmers really appreciated your expertise and having you there.  I hope you had an easy trip home.

I was interested too to learn that you may have poultry farm information for NC.  If that’s the case it would be great if it were possible for you to share it.  

Thanks,

Tanja
